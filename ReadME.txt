Description of project:
An AR space game where the user has to collect all the spacetrash to win. They will lose if there health gets to zero which would happen by collisions with other objects other than space trash. I acchieved this through watching youtube tutroials and researching online on how to make game obejcts and hwo to make scripts to get those objects to do what you want. The functionalities that I was not able to implement include the lunar space trash, out of bounds volume, the rear view camera, acceleration, the spot light, trash collection through touch, and a timer.

Nielsen Usability Heurisitc:
Visibility of System status: user can see when they collide with space trash as it turns red and dissapears. The score goes up. When it hits another object the health decreases. This way rhe user is informed of their current score and health. 
Match Between the System and the Real World: It has very minimal text and is very simple to understand. The joystick is clearly visible and easy to use making it familiar for the user to interact with.
User Control and Freedom: They can exit out of the app and the game will stop. 
Consistency and Standards: It uses very simple language and controls so it follows the standards. 
Error Prevention: If they hit another object it will decrease the score indicating incorrect behaviour. 
Recognition Rather than Recall: User doesn't need to remember much because all objects will be on screen including health and score. 
Flexibility and Efficiency of Use: This game is not very complex so there isn't shorcuts. 
Aesthetic and Minimalist Design: The design is very simple and minimilistc. The display has joystick, health and score aside from the actual game. 
Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors:
Help and Documentation: This readme file goes over a brief description of the game and what systems it was built on so that could be of help to the user. 

Overcoming problems:
I encountered a lot of problems. When i first started i didn't realize this was an AR project so I had to restart. I imported an asset which caused my whole project to dissapear and I had to start from scratch. I was having trouble getting the moons to rotate around the planet and then I read about the rotateAround function and that helped. I had trouble with user input for controlling the spaceship and found a youtbe tutuorial that helped me. I also had a hard time figuring out how to get the satellites to rotate in different planes but after researching I figured out how to do it. 

Free Assets used:
Joystick
spaceship
Magellan satellites
